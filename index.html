                    <p> Avanti's was my first job in high school. Even though I had worked on and off for my family's farm for years,<br> 
                        this was my first taste of real employment. I learned the in's and out's of restaurant service work and an <br>     
                        introduction to the joys of the customer service industry. Little did I know this job wold lay the groundwork for <br>
                        my current career. My time there ended when I started college, though i still visited when I was home from school.

                    <p>After I had left college without my degree I was in need of a job. My hometown was small so prospects were slim.<br>
                       A debt collection job nearby paid well and seemed like an interesting change of pace. I quickly learned that<br>
                       debt collection was not the job for me. I was collectiong on the same loans that I had used for college.<br>
                       I couldnt force myself to hound people about their debts. I heard so many stories of people that were down<br>
                       on their luck and couldnt pay their debts.But I have always had a good work ethic, so I stuck with it.<br>
                       After 10 months I decided to try moving west.

                <p>I started at Safeway 3 days after I arrived in Seattle. This was my first interaction with west coast chains.<br>
                   Top's Friendly Market was now Safeway. Tim Hortons was now Starbucks. I had never seen a supermarket that sold<br>
                   liquor and wine. In New York, wine and liquor can only be sold at liquor stores. And they are closed on sundays. <br>
                   I had never seen someone bring their dog into a supermarket before wither. But I learned alot about my new home, <br>
                   its people, and the differences of the coasts.
