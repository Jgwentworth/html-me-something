                    <p> Avanti's was my first job in high school. Even though I had worked on and off for my family's farm for years,<br> 
                        this was my first taste of real employment. I learned the in's and out's of restaurant service work and an <br>     
                        introduction to the joys of the customer service industry. Little did I know this job wold lay the groundwork for <br>
                        my current career. My time there ended when I started college, though i still visited when I was home from school.

                <p>After I had left college without my degree I was in need of a job. My hometown was small so prospects were slim.<br>
                   A debt collection job nearby paid well and seemed like an interesting change of pace. I quickly learned that<br>
                   debt collection was not the job for me. I was collectiong on the same loans that I had used for college.<br>
                   I couldnt force myself to hound people about their debts. I heard so many stories of people that were down<br>
                       on their luck and couldnt pay their debts.But I have always had a good work ethic, so I stuck with it.<br>
                       After 10 months I decided to try moving west.

                <h1>Safeway</h1>
                <h2>Seattle W.A.</h2>
                <h3>2012</h3>
                </div> 
             <img src="Tops.png"></img>    
                <p>I started at Safeway three days after I arrived in Seattle. This was my first interaction with west coast chains.<br>
                   Top's Friendly Market &reg; was now Safeway &reg;. Tim Hortons &reg; was now Starbucks &reg;. I had never seen a supermarket that<br>
                   sold liquor and wine. In New York, wine and liquor can only be sold at liquor stores. And they are closed on sundays. <br>
                   I had never seen someone bring their dog into a supermarket before either. But I learned alot about my new home, <br>
                   its people, and the differences of the coasts.

                <div class="headers">     
            <a name="Landmark"></a>
                <h1>The Ballard Landmark</h1>
                <h2>Seattle W.A.</h2>
                <h3>2012-2013</h3>
                </div>
            <img src="Ballard Landmark.jpg"></img>  
                <p>The next thing I learned about Seattle is that all the nice things come at a cost, that cost being a 300% increase<br>
                   in rent. So i needed a second, and possibly a third, source of income. I figured I'd use my high school restaurant<br>
                   experience and try retirement homes. The job itself I didnt really care for, But the people made it all worth it.<br>
                   I built friendships with some of the residents that I still keep with to this day. Sadly some have passed, but the<br>
                   relationships I made with those residents will stay with me forever.

                <div class="headers">    
            <a name="Picolinos"></a>
                <h1>Ristorante Picolinos</h1>
                <h2>Seattle W.A.</h2>
                <h3>2012-</h3>
                </div>   
            <img src="Picolinos.jpg"></img>
                <p>Ristorante Picolinos became that third job I was talking about. I learned that Seattle had a more favorable stance<br>
                   towards the service industry. I applied at every restaurant I could find and ended up choosing Ristorante Picolinos.<br>
                   I started working there two days a week as a bus boy. Over the years I learned about every aspect of a restaurant.<br>
                   Iin the span of almost 5 years I have worked my way up to Restaurant Manager, studying Italian wines and foods, learning<br>
                   the bookkeeping and the labor costs. I have built countless connections with clients in the restaurant, and even brought<br>
                   some of my own in, from relationships with previous jobs. After a year of management I've learned alot about people,<br>
                   food and drinks. I never would have thought that my job in high school would lead me to this point.

                <p>Ive always been interested in computers and computer science. This class has taken something so mythical as the internet<br>
                and made it understandable. In two months I've learened enough about coding that I am now fully invested in exploring a career in it.<br>
