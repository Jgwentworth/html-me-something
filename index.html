                <p> Avanti's was my first job in high school. Even though I had worked on and off for my family's farm for years,<br> 
                    this was my first taste of real employment. I learned the in's and out's of restaurant service work and an <br>     
                    introduction to the joys of the customer service industry. Little did I know this job wold lay the groundwork for <br>
                    my current career. My time there ended when I started college, though i still visited when I was home from school.</p>
