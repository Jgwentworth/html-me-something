                    <p> Avanti's was my first job in high school. Even though I had worked on and off for my family's farm for years,<br> 
                        this was my first taste of real employment. I learned the in's and out's of restaurant service work and an <br>     
                        introduction to the joys of the customer service industry. Little did I know this job wold lay the groundwork for <br>
                        my current career. My time there ended when I started college, though i still visited when I was home from school.

                    <p>After I had left college without my degree I was in need of a job. My hometown was small so prospects were slim.<br>
                       A debt collection job nearby paid well and seemed like an interesting change of pace. I quickly learned that<br>
                       debt collection was not the job for me. I was collectiong on the same loans that I had used for college.<br>
                       But I have always had a good work ethic, so I stuck with it. After 10 months I decided to try moving west.
